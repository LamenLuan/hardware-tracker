# hardware-tracker
This python script is built to track a product price in the three biggest brazilian hardware e-commerces (Kabum, Pichau, Terabyteshop), storing that information on a google spreadsheet, and notificating me when price hit a new minimun. This is my first experience with python, don't expect much from it ðŸ™‚

I learned that configuration in this [video](https://youtu.be/bu5wXjz2KvU):
- In a project, enable Google Drive and Google Sheets APIs
- Generate a client email in Sheets API screen
- Create a JSON private key from this client
- Put this JSON in a directory called "gspread" in your project directory
- Give edit permission in a sheet called "tracking-sheet" to the client by its
 email
- Rename work sheet as "BestPrice"
### If you are a Windows user, to this do run automaticaly when you logon
- Go to "scrapper_copy.bat" and put the project directory path in 
 "project_directory"
